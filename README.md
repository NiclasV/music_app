What it is:

This is a simple Application for creating your ultimate playlist using tracks from the folksa.ga music API.
You can search for tracks, add them to the playlist but also delete tracks from the playlist.
It's a progressive web application so thanks to a service-worker(thanks buddy) it caches both the shell (html, css, javascript, images) but also the data from the API which enables it to work offline!

Sounds awesome? Of course it does!
I understand that you're excited to get going,

And here's how you do it:

1. You need to use Chrome, and the you need to install and launch a web-server using: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en

2. After its installed, you go to "apps" in the browser and you shall find "webserver for chrome", launch it!

3. You need to download this project, and in the settings for the webserver you have to choose the folder that you downloaded.

4. In the webserver settings, you'll see "Webserver URL" this is the adress where the simulated webserver is hosting this app, click the IP and that should be it!


Enjoy
